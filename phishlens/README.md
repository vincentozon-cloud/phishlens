## 👨‍💻 Technical Learnings
While building PhishLens, I focused on:
1. **Asynchronous UI:** Managing "Scanning" states to improve User Experience.
2. **Immutable State:** Using the spread operator to update history lists without mutating data.
3. **Conditional Rendering:** Dynamically changing UI themes based on security risk scores.
